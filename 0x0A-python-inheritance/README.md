This is 0x0A-python-inheritance solution 
Python inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

In Python, when a class inherits from another class, it automatically gains access to all the attributes and methods of the parent class. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, and the class that is inherited from is called the superclass or base class.
